<p>This figure represents the Pearson's correlations between module eigengenes 
defined at the previous step and the clinical traits available, as well as the 
associated p-values (correlation (p-value)). The intensity of the colour 
corresponds to the strength of the correlation (red and blue for positive and 
negative correlations respectively, see scale on the right side of the plot).</p>
<p>If the values are not easily readable it is possible to download them as a 
csv file by clicking on the <strong>Download Module Trait Association</strong> 
button.</p>
<p>A useful check for module definitions can be performed here: there should 
be very few (if any) significant correlations between the grey module and the 
clinical traits, else the user should probably go back to the <strong>Network 
Construction</strong> step, tweak the parameters and compute the network 
and/or detect the modules again.</p>
