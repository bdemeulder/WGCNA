<p>Here the user can further study gene modules correlated with a clinical 
trait of interest. The user can choose to plot Static or Interactive figures 
by clicking on the corresponding radio button. Interactive figures take more 
time to render but present interesting features for exploration of the results. 
The figures will updated when the user chooses either another module or another 
trait of interest in the pull-down menus.</p>
<p> The figures represent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The expression values of the module eigengene of interest across all 
  samples (top left), which can help to identify modules that might be driven by 
  only one or few sample(s) and which might not be of much interest,</li> 
  <li>The correlation of the chosen module eigengene value against the chosen 
  clinical trait values in each sample (top right), along with the correlation 
  line (R, R2 and p-value of the correlation),</li>
  <li>The gene significance across modules (bottom left), which shows the 
  biological relevance for all genes in all modules related to the clinical 
  trait studied, </li>
  <li>The module membership vs gene significance (bottom right), which shows 
  the genes significance to chosen trait (<em>i.e.</em> absolute correlation 
  between each gene of the chosen module and the chosen trait) and the module 
  membership of each gene (<em>i.e.</em> the correlation between each gene and 
  the eigengene of the chosen module). The user can select dots on the 
  plot (by brushing over the region of interest in the plot) and have more 
  details about those genes (shown in a table below the plots).</li>
</ul>
<p>The user can download the gene significance and module membership values 
used to plot the figures by clicking on the <strong>Download Gene 
Significance</strong> and <strong>Module Membership</strong> button. The HTML
