<p>This application stops the analysis process at the gene modules 
identification and relation with clinical variables.</p> 
<p>The next step in interpreting the results would be to submit modules 
correlated with a clinical trait of interest to an enrichment analysis tool, in 
order to explore the biological meaning of said modules.</p> 
<p>This can be done by exporting the module definitions (by clicking on the 
<strong>Download module assignments</strong> button at the end of section 2) and 
uploading each module to the userâ€™s favourite enrichment software. Usual choices 
include 
<a href = "http://ipscience.thomsonreuters.com/product/metacore/">MetaCore</a>, 
<a href = "http://www.ingenuity.com/products/ipa">Ingenuity Pathway Analysis</a>, 
<a href = "http://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/">g:Profiler</a> or 
<a href = "https://david.ncifcrf.gov/">DAVID</a>.</p> 
<p>A clearer picture of the molecular mechanisms involved in the correlation 
with a clinical trait can be obtained by collating enrichment analysis results 
from all modules correlated with said clinical trait.</p>
