<p>The gene network of one or multiple selected module(s) is represented. A link 
threshold can be specified, which will remove links with a lower weight 
(<em>i.e.</em> lower correlation). The user can also choose to remove or keep 
in the network unlinked nodes by ticking the box. The names of the genes are 
shown when hovering the mouse over the nodes in this network.</p> 
<p>The network can be exported as zip file containing two csv tables, one for 
the nodes and one for the edges. These tables can be opened in external graph 
visualisation softwares. The <strong>Download Shown Network</strong> button only 
exports the current view of the network and the <strong>Download Whole 
Network</strong> button exports the complete network (keep in mind that building 
the full network can be resource demanding). </p>
