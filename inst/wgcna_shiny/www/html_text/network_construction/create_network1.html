<h3 style = "margin-top: 10px">Compute Network</h3>
<p> The Network can be constructed either in an automated or manual way 
(<strong>Automatic</strong> or <strong>Manual</strong> Construction Method 
respectively).
</p> 
<p>If the user chooses to use the <strong>Manual</strong> network computation, 
he/she will have access to additional parameters for module detection.</p>
<p>The user can specify the soft power (by default the red value in the 
previous step) and the <strong>Topology Overlap Matrix</strong> 
(<strong>TOM</strong>) type (only for unsigned network). The central idea of 
TOM is to take into account the direct connection strengths as well as 
connection strengths mediated by shared neighbours.</p>
<p>TOM type can be:</p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Unsigned:</strong> consider all links as having the same effect,</li>
    <li> <strong>Signed:</strong> consider the possibility of negative feedback.</li> 
</ul>
<p>Once the parameters are chosen, the user can click on the <strong>Calculate 
Network</strong> button to compute the network accordingly.</p>
<p>Resulting modules are then represented by their module eigengenes (virtual 
genes representing each module). The tree of the module eigengenes ("Clustering 
of module eigengenes") is found in the first part of the figure under the 
parameter box. It represents how correlated the module eigengenes are to each 
other. The second part of the figure ("Cluster dendrogram") represents the 
dendrogram of the genes, the first band of colors represents the initial 
modules, and the second band represents the merged modules if any merging 
happened.</p>
