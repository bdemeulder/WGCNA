<h3>Detect Modules</h3> 
<p>If the user chooses the <strong>Automatic</strong> construction method, 
module detection uses default values for the needed parameters.
</p>
<p>If the user chooses the <strong>Manual</strong> construction method, he/she 
will have access to the following parameters:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Min module size</strong> (by default 30 genes): minimum number 
  of genes in a module,</li>
  <li><strong>Max joining height</strong> (by default 0.995): genes above this 
  threshold in the Cluster Dendrogram are put in the grey module (~garbage 
  module), </li>
  <li><strong>Depth of split</strong> (by default 2): depth of branch allowed 
  for the module detection (from 0 to 4).</li>
</ul>
<p>The parameter values will influence the way WGCNA defines the initial set 
of gene modules. The user can click on the <strong>Define Initial Modules
</strong> button to launch the computation.
</p> 
<p>The modules can then be iteratively merged (by clicking on the <strong>
Merge Close Module</strong> button) if they are similar enough (<em>i.e.</em> 
below the merge threshold). The red line in the "Clustering of module eigengenes" 
plot shows roughly which modules are going to be merged (the grey module is never 
merged). As the merging works iteratively, decreasing the <strong>Threshold to 
Merge Modules</strong> between 2 iterations will have no effect.
</p>
<p>For the manual computation, the modules are defined initially using the 
default parameters but their values can be changed and the modules will have 
to be re-initialised by clicking on the <strong>Define Initial Modules
</strong> button.
