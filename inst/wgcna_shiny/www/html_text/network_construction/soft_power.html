<p>The correlation values will be elevated to the power <strong>&beta;</strong> 
(called <strong>soft power</strong>), in order to exacerbate the high correlation 
values and improve the signal to noise ratio.</p>
<p>The value of this soft power has to be chosen such that the resulting network 
shows an approximate scale-free topology (SFT; meaning that the degree distribution 
of the network follows a power-law) as presented in the top left plot.</p>
<p>The other three plots can also be used to check the scale-free topology fit: 
there should be few nodes with a high connectivity (hub genes), hence a low mean 
and median connectivity and a high maximum connectivity.</p>
<p>The first integer value of the soft power for which the scale-free topology 
fit is above 80% is highlighted in red in the plots and automatically selected 
(but it can be adjusted manually in the next step).</p>
