  <h2 style = "margin-top: 10px">What is WGCNA?</h2>
  <p><strong>Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis</strong> 
  (<strong>WGCNA</strong>) is a widely used data mining and analysis method 
  developed to study biological networks based on pairwise correlations between 
  variables.</p>
  <p>This method was first published by B. Zhang and S. Horvath 
  (<strong><a href = "http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/sagmb.2005.4.issue-1/sagmb.2005.4.1.1128/sagmb.2005.4.1.1128.xml"> 
  A general framework for weighted gene co-expression network analysis </a>
  </strong>, <em>Statistical applications in genetics and molecular 
  biology</em>, 4 (1), 2005).</p>
  <p>Although mainly used to analyse gene expression data, WGCNA is suited to 
  analyse any type of continuous biological omics data.  The rationale behind 
  this method is to use the correlations levels between the omics features to 
  extract meaningful results, complementing the traditional methods of omics 
  data analysis who focus on statistically relevant differences of expression 
  and/or abundance of the omics features between groups.</p>
  
  <h2>What does this application do?</h2>
  <p>This application allows users with little or no coding skills to try, 
  explore and play with the WGCNA method. In order to make this experience as 
  straightforward as possible, two demo datasets of gene expression in mice are 
  provided. The user also has the possibility to upload his/her own data, by 
  following the formatting rules described in the next tab. At any point of the 
  analysis, the user can choose to save his/her progress in form of a .rda file 
  by clicking the <strong>Save</strong> button at the top of the page. Saving
  a large scale analysis will take some time and space. Then the user can load 
  a saved session by choosing <strong>Load Previous State</strong> in the Data 
  Input section.</p>
  <p>In general terms, this application will let the user:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>choose among the two datasets of mice gene expression data, 
    alternatively upload their own datasets, provided it is properly 
    formatted,</li>
    <li>generate a correlation network of all genes available in the selected 
    dataset,</li> 
    <li>interrogate this network to identify groups of genes (modules) 
    correlated with each other,</li>
    <li>cross these gene modules with available clinical data,</li>
    <li>explore the relations between gene modules and</li>
    <li>generate a network of modules and export it to the userâ€™s favourite 
    network visualization software.</li>
  </ul>
